title: About This Project
---

<p>This is my project to improve upon <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/statistics/surveys/mbk/index.html">the open data sets provided by the Department of Education as part of their My Brother’s Keeper Task Force</a>, which recommended that government make available and encourage adoption of critical indicators of life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their peers.</p>
<p>My goal is to make the open data more accessible in publications, visualizations, website, and mobile applicaitons. Right now they are available as open data (CSV, Excel), and if we can also make available as API endpoints, it will increase the chances the data is put to work.
<p>You can follow the <a href="/roadmap/">roadmap to learn what is next</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/my-brothers-keeper-statistical-indicators/issues">submit issues via this projects Github repository</a>, which drives the roadmap. This work is not affiliated with My Brother’s Keeper Task Force, but is looking to improve on the data from the outside-in.</p>
<p>Being the change we want to see in government.</p>
