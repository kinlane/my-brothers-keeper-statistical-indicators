<p>I needed a project for my Restlet API Spark Summer of APIs Workshop, and wanted it to reflect the type of open data work I would like see occur.</p>
<p>This is just the first, hello world blog post, but I will try to make this blog be something you can read in its entirety and understand everything about the project.</p>
<p>This blog will not necessarily be chronological, even though there will be dates applied, I will update and add older posts to help walk you through the project.</p>
